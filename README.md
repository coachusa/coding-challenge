# coding-challenge
This will be a Java pairing exercise that will last up to 60 minutes.

You will be given problems to solve in stages.

You can ask your pair any clarifications you'd like about requirements.

## Preparation for the coding challenge
**Before the interview** please read through the notes below and then create a blank Java project in your favourite IDE.

Please use which ever version of Java you're most comfortable with.

## What we value
* Open transparent communication
  * Please talk through your thinking as you go along
  * If you need help or clarification, you'll ask
* Quality first development
  * Working dev environment
  * Build file that compiles your code and runs the tests
  * Test driven development
  * Comprehensive unit tests and test coverage
  * Solving the problem in-hand - please don't over architect the code
  * Complexity of the code should be in proportion to the complexity of the task
