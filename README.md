# coding-challenge
This will be a code writing pairing exercise that will last up to 60 minutes.

You will be given problems to solve in stages.

You can ask your pair any clarifications you'd like about requirements.

## Preparation for the coding challenge
**Before the interview** please read through the notes below and then create a blank project in your favourite IDE for the programming language of the role you're applying for.

For instance if you're applying for a prodominently Java programming role, create a Java project for a currently supported version of Java.

## What we value
* Open transparent communication
  * Please talk through your thinking as you go along
  * If you need help or clarification, you'll ask
* Quality first development
  * Working dev environment
  * Build file that compiles your code and runs the tests
  * Test driven development
  * Comprehensive unit tests and test coverage
  * Solving the problem in-hand - please don't over architect the code
  * Complexity of the code should be in proportion to the complexity of the task
